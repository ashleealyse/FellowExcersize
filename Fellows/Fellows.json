My fascination with computers grew, from using to building my own desktops. Learning code seemed like the right fit. I find coding deeply satisfies my creative and logical side. I hope to achieve a deep understanding and readiness for a long career as a software engineer. With the lessons learned at C4Q I hope to be adaptable for a constant evolving industry. A fun fact about me is that I lift heavy things and set the back down, as a hobby."
